1. Change working directory  to `packages/component`. The component can be `button`, `body`, or one of the components located in the packages folder.
```sh
cd packages/component
```

2. Install all dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

3. Run local servers and watch for changes:

```sh
yarn dev
```
